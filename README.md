- 👋 Hi, I’m @GowdaAmit
- 👀 I’m interested in developing IT Enabled products using cutting edge technologies. I have worked both in teams and in individual capacity to develop projects 
    in business establishments. I have developed applications using Python, C#, VB, JSP, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, OLAP and PHP. I even ran a publishing company 
    producing online health magazine that was having under 50K Alexa ranking during 2010-12. Did SEO, digital promotion et al. 
    
    I have worked in several verticals including Heavy Machinery Manufacturing, Telecommunications, Textile Processing companies in various IT capacities. Trained and 
    Built teams of software developers to develop cutting edge information tools for Management Information & thereby aiding managers to take critical business decisions.
    
    Having done my Engineering in Electronics and Communications, I have developed a product using Raspberry Pico micro controller with interface to GSM Class 10 GPRS 
    module. This solutions enables business to manage que of customers by accessing simple Mobile based app. I am intending to put that code on Github. The code is 
    developed in Micropython that needs deeper understanding of Microcontroller and TCP Sockets. 
    
    - 🌱 I’m currently learning Haskell. Haskell Language is intuitive and refreshing. It is like framing mathematical formulas and it has steep learning curve.
    
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that requires creativity and innovation
